#Thousand Cranes

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

Load testing framework with an F# DSL.

Supports running scenarios locally via a lightweight console app or by distributed workers in THE CLOUD (Azure)!

Running workers in Azure and collating their results is easy with the provided Azure supervisor project.

Very loosely based on the [Gatling](http://gatling.io/) load testing project.

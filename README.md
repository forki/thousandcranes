#Thousand Cranes

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

Load testing framework with an F# DSL.

Supports running scenarios locally via a lightweight console app or by distributed workers in THE CLOUD!

Running workers in AWS and collating their results is easy with the provided AWS worker/supervisor projects.

Very loosely based on the [Gatling](http://gatling.io/) load testing project.
